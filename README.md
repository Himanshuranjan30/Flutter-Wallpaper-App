# GoTo-Challenge

# Goal

To design an app that a user can launch, quickly view and download a wallpaper of his/her liking. The app is not supposed to occupy you for a long period of time. All of this coupled with an elegant and smart UI and we have the app.

# Gestures Goals

You'll need to add the following gestures to the app

- Swipe gesture (horizontal) to browse the images.
- Double tap gesture to download the wallpaper (anywhere in the screen).
- Hold gesture in the left side to get a lock screen preview of the wallpaper.
- Hold gesture in the right side to get a home screen preview of the wallpaper.
- Shake gesture to fetch new 10 images from the Unsplash
- You'll need to show a loading screen while the app is fetching images


# Gestures I did:

- Swipe gesture (horizontal) to browse the images.
- Double tap gesture to download the wallpaper (anywhere in the screen).
- Shake gesture to fetch new 10 images from the Unsplash
- You'll need to show a loading screen while the app is fetching images

# Instructions before using this app:
- The API usage request for my app didnt get accepted in the time period of 3 days so i used a deprecated API Link that can cause error using this app with the apk.
- As i didnt get the full api access i coudnt fetch more than 30 images at a time i.e only 3 sets of 10 images were shown in this app.
- Lockscreen and Homescreen gestures were not implemented by me in this app as it requires native code to be written and integrated with Flutter.
- Im still not a professional flutter dev but an intermediate and getting a chance to learn from your team and working with you guys will be a great boost for my     programming career.
