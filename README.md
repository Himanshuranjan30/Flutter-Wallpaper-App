# Flutter Wallpaper App

# Goal

To design an app that a user can launch, quickly view and download a wallpaper of his/her liking. The app is not supposed to occupy you for a long period of time. All of this coupled with an elegant and smart UI and we have the app.

# Gestures goals:

- Swipe gesture (horizontal) to browse the images.
- Double tap gesture to download the wallpaper (anywhere in the screen).
- Shake gesture to fetch new 10 images from the Unsplash
- You'll need to show a loading screen while the app is fetching images
